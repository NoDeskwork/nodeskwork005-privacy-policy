      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 28, 2025</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how NoDeskwork ("we", "our", or "the App") handles your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>Camera and Video</h3>
      <p>The App uses your device's camera to record videos. Videos are recorded only when you explicitly initiate recording.</p>

      <h3>Uploaded Content</h3>
      <p>Your recorded videos are uploaded to our cloud storage service. You can monitor (or cancel if required) uploads with progress bars on the app's screen. We store these videos to provide AI video analysis service on our website for you.</p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the recorded videos solely to provide our core functionality of video recording, upload and AI analysis services.</p>

      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>Videos are stored securely using industry-standard encryption. We retain uploaded videos until you close your account or delete them by your request.</p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You can:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Choose not to grant camera permissions (the app will not function without them)</li>
          <li>Request deletion of your videos by contacting us</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <strong>support@nodeskwork.com</strong></p>
