      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 22, 2025</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how NoDeskwork ("we", "our", or "the App") handles your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>Camera and Video</h3>
      <p>The App uses your device's camera to record videos. Videos are recorded only when you explicitly initiate recording.</p>

      <h3>Uploaded Content</h3>
      <p>When you choose to upload videos, they are transmitted to our cloud storage service (Cloudflare). We store these videos to provide the app's functionality.</p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the recorded videos solely to provide the app's core functionality of video recording and upload services.</p>

      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>Videos are stored securely using industry-standard encryption. We retain uploaded videos until you delete them or close your account.</p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You can:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Choose not to grant camera permissions (the app will not function without them)</li>
          <li>Delete your uploaded videos at any time</li>
          <li>Request deletion of your data by contacting us</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Contact Us</h2>
